# Version 8.0.0
- Dual license: GNU GPL and paid proprietary license for commercial purposes
- Requires Python >=3.9
- Engines can operate more efficiently using vectorization by means of numpy arrays (floats operation still supported)
- Arguments that can be float and numpy arrays are now of type fl.Scalar (see fuzzylite/types.py)
- Arguments that can only be arrays of floats are now fl.ScalarArray (see fuzzylite/types.py)
- Op.scalar now converts any argument to a numpy array, instead of a float
- Op.to_float converts any argument to a float, which is the old behaviour of Op.scalar.
- All enum values are automatically assigned with enum.auto(), instead of manual assignments
- New: Arc and SemiEllipse terms.
- Using `from __future__ import annotations` in every file to use better type annotations

## __init__.py
- fl.inf, fl.nan, fl.isnan, fl.isinf now map to their numpy equivalents

## activation.py
- Only General activation support vector operations, other methods require still float operations

## defuzzifier.py
- Integral defuzzifiers are vectorized, so they operate efficiently on vector operations.
- Integral defuzzifiers use 1000 steps instead of 100
- Weighted defuzzifiers were refactored
- Bug fix: Weighted defuzzifiers were not infering the type correctly (see WeightedDefuzzifier::infer_type)
- WeightedSum produces nan values if the fuzzy output is empty

## engine.py
- New: Engine.input_values() and Engine.output_values() produce 2D matrices with their respective values

## exporter.py
- Discrete term exported as `Discrete.create(name: str, values: dict[float, float])`

## factory.py
- New: Arc and SemiEllipse added to TermFactory
- FunctionFactory: Operators and Functions now map to their equivalent methods in numpy, but preserving their previous names

## hedges.py
- Vectorized all hedges

## library.py
- New: rtol parameter for relative tolerance across the library
- Renamed: `abs_tolerance` renamed to `atol`
- Moved: `floating_point_type` moved to `types.py` and renamed to `float_type`

## norm.py
- Vectorized all norms

## operation.py
- Vectorized all comparative operations (eq, neq, lt, le, gt, ge)
- Removed tolerance from all comparative operations (eq, neq, lt, le, gt, ge)
- Improved: numpy for all operations
- Changed: empty identifiers now return "_" instead of "unnamed" (see `as_identifier(name:str)`
- Removed: `pi` method.
- Removed: `slots` parameter in `describe` method.
- Moved: `scalar` method to `types.py`
- New: `midpoints` method to discretize a range of values into a list of midpoints

## rule.py
- Enabled vectorization
- Changed: in `Rule`, `triggered` is now an array of bools and `activation_degrees` is now a Scalar to support vectorization

## term.py
- All terms are vectorized: membership and tsukamoto functions return fl.Scalar
- All equations are simplified and use numpy
- New: Arc edge and SemiEllipsis terms
- Fix: Tsukamoto functions use the term's height
- Fix: Bugs in Tsukamoto functions for Concave
- New: `_parse` method to parse configuration parameters
- Change: Term.tsukamoto now raises exception if the term is not monotonic, before it returned the membership function value
- Change: Term.discretize now discretizes by default using midpoints
- Change: Activated.degree is a property now that automatically replaces nan and inf values
- Change: Discrete.values are now a numpy array instead of list of Discrete.Pair
- Removed: Discrete.Pair
- Change: Discrete.membership interpolates with numpy, which takes the first or last y-value for x-values beyond range
- Removed: Discrete.pairs_from, Discrete.values_from, Discrete.dict_from, Discrete.list_from
- New: Discrete.to_list, Discrete.to_dict, Discrete.to_xy
- New: Discrete.create to create a Discrete term from a list, dict or pairs
